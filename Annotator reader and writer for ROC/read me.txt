This archive contains four MATLAB files and xml reader tool-box. There are two main files; 

1.“browsetraining.m”: 

First part of the script includes reading of ‘.xml’ file containing annotations of an image set and writes in a matlab-friendly matrix.  This script interactively takes paths of directory containing image set and its corresponding annotation (.xml) file.  It writes one text file per image in the specified directory or in directory “trngpts” if it exists in the current working directory.  Second part of the script, reads annotations from the generated text files and displays (writes) a overlaid annotation copy of the original image. These overlaid images are saved the directory ‘gt’ inside the directory containing original dataset. 

2.“writexml.m”: 

This script takes .txt files containing annotation of individual test image which is generated by a microaneurysms (MA) detection algorithm and generate a single annotation .xml file of entire image set as per ROC specifications. It can be used to generate result xml file of a MA detection method. 

**********************


First cut (to read annotation): 

1.Run “browsetraining.m”. Give path of xml annotation file and image set directory. 

2.Check the .txt annotation file per image in the image set directory (of in ‘trngpts’, if it is created in the current working directory)
